🔥 Forest Fire Risk Prediction Web App
A machine learning web application that predicts the risk of forest fires based on real-time environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other key fire indices.

🚀 Built with Flask, scikit-learn, and deployed on Render, this project provides a clean, interactive web interface to forecast fire risks and support proactive environmental monitoring.
